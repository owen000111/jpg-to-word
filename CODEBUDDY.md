# CODEBUDDY.md This file provides guidance to CodeBuddy Code when working with code in this repository.

Repository overview
- Current contents: README.md only. No source code, configuration, or automation files are present.

Commands
- Build, lint, test, and dev commands are not defined in this repository at present.
- Once implementation files are added, derive commands from project tooling (e.g., package manager scripts or language-specific tools) and update this section accordingly, including single-test invocation.

Architecture
- High-level architecture cannot be summarized yet because no implementation files exist.
- When code is added, document major modules, data flow, and key integration points here to accelerate future work.

Linked rules and docs
- No CLAUDE.md, Cursor rules, Copilot instructions, AGENTS.md, or extended README content found. If these are added, extract and summarize critical operating rules here.
